# Simple Sales Report

---

Welcome everyone! This project is designed to create three reports based on an Excel table.

The main table contains sales data from various stores, organized into 7 columns (sale code, date, store, product, sales quantity, unit value and total value). The project analyzes the total revenue, overall sales, and average ticket for each store.

In a world where handling large datasets is crucial, we need practical methods to extract required information efficiently and share it effectively.

## Learnings and Thoughts

Through this project, I delved into managing databases using the Pandas library. Initially, my challenge wasn’t understanding 'what' I needed but rather 'how' to access it. This project taught me data manipulation, formatting, and extraction techniques.

The second part involves sending emails with the reports, where the Win32com library came in handy. It allows me to send reports without even opening my email, I just input the recipients.

However, the primary challenge when dealing with emails is presenting the information in an attractive, concise, and reader-friendly manner. For this purpose, I utilized the Babel library, which assisted in formatting currencies and decimals.

While it's a simple project, it employs practical and valuable resources.
